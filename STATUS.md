# Project Dreki STATUS

This file summarizes all changes made to the Project Dreki expense tracker app during this development session (as of September 17, 2025).

## Model Changes
- **Expense Model**: Added two new fields:
  - `whereMade: String` — records where the expense was made.
  - `whatPurchased: String` — records what was purchased.
- **Project Model**: Added a `completed: Bool` flag to indicate if a project is finished.

## Expense Management
- **Add/Edit Expense**: UI and logic updated to support entering and editing the new `Where` and `What` fields for each expense.
- **Expense List**: Displays the new fields for each expense in the project ledger.

## Project Completion Feature
- **Mark as Completed**: Added a toggle in the project detail view to mark a project as completed. When marked, the project is hidden from the main list.
- **Completed Projects History**: Added a way to view completed projects:
  - Replaced the previous popup/sheet with a toggle in the main view.
  - The toggle switches between showing current (uncompleted) and completed projects in the main list.
  - The project list updates instantly based on the toggle state.

## UI/UX Improvements
- **Toggle for Completed Projects**: The main project list now features a toggle to switch between current and completed projects.
- **Selection Reset**: Whenever the completed projects toggle is changed, the selected project is cleared to avoid showing details for a project that may no longer be visible.
- **Deprecation Fix**: Updated the `onChange` modifier to use the new closure signature, resolving a macOS 14.0 deprecation warning.

## Files Modified
- `Models.swift`: Updated models for Expense and Project.
- `ProjectDetailView.swift`: Added UI and logic for new expense fields and project completion toggle.
- `ContentView.swift`: Added completed projects toggle, selection reset, and integrated completed projects view into the main list.
- `CompletedProjectsView.swift`: Created and later deprecated in favor of integrated toggle view.

## Testing & Validation
- All changes were validated for errors after each step.
- Edge cases (such as selection reset and toggle logic) were tested for robustness.
